This program takes as input a large resolution image (10000:10000) that contains words arranged either vertically or horizontally.
The program processes the image, determines the position of the words and changes the background color behind each word to (255 - R, 255 - G, 255 - B), where (R, G, B) is the color of each individual word.


"result_4.png" contains an image of the intermediate word processing.
